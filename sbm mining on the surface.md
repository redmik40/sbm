of overburden Strip mining is the mining of a relatively flat deposit very close to the surface,commonly used in coal or phosphate industri How Are Diamonds Mined And Extracted From the Ground Because marine deposits are distributed over large areas unevenly,mining companies utilize different methods to mine them Some of these methods include shallow water mining,deep sea operations involving high tech equipment and simple alluvial mining Like open pit mining,the ore materials are usually transported offsite for further processing Environmental Risks of Mining ISL mining has environmental and safety advantages over conventional mining in that the ore body is dissolved and then pumped out,leaving minimal surface disturbance and no tailings or waste rock (World Nuclear Association,2012) The
