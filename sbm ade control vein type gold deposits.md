Low Sulfide Quartz Gold Model 1 Low Sulfide Quartz Gold Deposit Model By Lawrence J.Drew U.S.Geological Survey Reston,VA 20192 Deposits in this class have been widely described and given many names: • Mesothermal gold • Mother lode type • Homestake type • Low Regional structural control on the distribution of world&#226; class gold deposits: An overview from the Giant Jiaodong Gold … Regional structural control on the distribution of world‐class gold deposits: An overview from the Giant Jiaodong Gold Province,China.In contrast,predominant vein‐type gold deposits in the eastern segment of the Jiaobei and Sulu terranes tend to form N S. Polymetallic replacement deposit A polymetallic replacement deposit,also known as carbonate replacement deposit or high temperature carbonate hosted Ag Pb Zn deposit,[2] is an orebody of metallic minerals formed by the replacement of sedimentary,usually carbonate rock,by metal bearing solutions in the vicinity of igneous intrusions.[3] When the ore forms a blanketlike body. Orogenic gold deposits: A proposed classification in the … The so called `mesothermal' gold deposits are a distinctive type of gold deposit which is typified by many consistent features in space and time.These have been summarized in a variety of comprehensive ore deposit model descriptions that include Bohlke (1982),Colvine et al.(1984),Berger (1986),Groves and Foster (1991),Nesbitt (1991),Hodgson (1993)and Robert (1996).
