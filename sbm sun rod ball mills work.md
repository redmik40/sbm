How Rod Mills Function Pod Shifter Rod mills are more like ball mills that works to pulverize hard materials into smaller pieces.The only difference is that with rod mills,long rods are employed to grind hard materials.Rod mills pulverize materials by grinding with other materials inside the mill just like how ball mills grind against the materials fed into the machine. Eriez Magnetic Mill Liner Instead,the metal magnetic mill liner will adsorb the ball chips and debris to its surface and prevent its discharge from the mill while the solid protection layer is formed.The smaller sized ball chips are sorted out and separated from the primary ball charge.These ball chips and other debris work as the liner and no excess energy is required. Ball Mill Ball mills are among the most variable and effective tools when it comes to size reduction of hard,brittle or fibrous materials.The variety of grinding modes,usable volumes and available grinding tool materials make ball mills the perfect match for a vast range of applications. Multi Compartment Rod Ball Mill Evaluation on Bauxite. Rod mills generate small amounts of fines,as fine particles typically accumulate in the space between rods without enduring comminution [2].Effective grinding of this material occurs in the ball mill compartment,generating finer fragmentation.The Bond Rod Mill Work Index (BRMWI) test was only possible for Blend 5 (Table 2) due to excessive Ball Mills Mine Engineer.Com Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1 4 inch and finer,down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns.To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills,they must be operated in a closed system,with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced.
