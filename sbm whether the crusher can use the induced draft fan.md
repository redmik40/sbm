sbm whether the crusher can use the induced draft fanAir Coolers: Forced vs Induced draft &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;If gear drives are used,this adds a bit more to the complexity,since there would be an additional coupling between the gear and the fan shaft.On forced draft coolers with gear drives,the fan can usually be mounted directly on the output shaft of the gear.That is the major mechanical difference between most forced draft and induced draft. Combustion Air When installing new equipment or troubleshooting problem equipment,the first determination that needs to be made is whether the equipment is located in a confined or unconfined space.Fan In A Can.The CAS 4 Fan In A Can is designed for use with any natural gas or LP burning furnace,water heater,or boiler with a 24 VAC control system.
