FAQs Why is it important to design concrete pipe to the 0.inch crack? A: Reinforced concrete pipe,like other reinforced concrete structures,is designed to crack.It is well known that while concrete is very strong in compression,its tensile strength is so low that it is considered negligible in design. How to Install Reinforced Concrete Pipe (RCP) Reinforced concrete pipes must be handled and moved carefully to prevent damaging the bell (the wide or flared end of the pipe sections) and the spigot (the narrow end that is inserted into the bell of an adjoining pipe).RCP should never be dragged to the site.It is best if the pipes are unloaded with the use of a nylon sling or other.
