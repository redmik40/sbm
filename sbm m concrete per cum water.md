Civil Work 20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;No.on bricks per 1cu.m= 1 volume of1st class brick with motor =1 0.002 = 500 no?s of bricks STANDARD CONVERSION FACTORS INCH = 25.4 MILLIMETRE. Density Of Concrete A normal weight concrete weighs 2400 kg per cubic meter or 145 lbs per cubic foot (3915 lbs per cubic yard).The unit weight of concrete (density) varies depending on the amount and density of the aggregate,the amount of entrained air (and entrapped air),and the water and cement content. Mix Design M Grade The mix design M grade (Using Admixture Sikament) provided here is for reference purpose only.Actual site conditions vary and thus this should be adjusted as per the location and other factors.Parameters for mix design M50.Grade Designation = M Type of cement = O.P.C grade Brand of cement = Vikram ( Grasim ) How To Calculate Water Content For 1 m&#179; M25 Concrete How To Calculate Water Content For 1 m&#179; M25 Concrete? The calculation of water content for 1 m&#179; M25 concrete is very easy and simple.We just need to know: 1.Consumption of cement per m&#179; 2.Water cement ratio.Here,Grade of concrete is M25.If it’s a design mix,both of these parameters shall […] Cost of Concreting Per m3 (Cubic Metre) 19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Calculating the costs of concreting in three dimensions (per cubic metre) is different than square metre rates.The supply cost of concreting starts from roughly $300 per cubic metre,while labour costs for hiring concreters run from $80 hr.
