What affects cone crusher performance? — Sandvik Mining. Any fluctuation in pressure means that the optimal force will not be delivered consistently so,of course,crusher performance declines.These are the two main causes of sub optimal crushing performance,but losses in the reduction ratio can also be caused by selecting the wrong mantle or by having a poor chamber profile or design.
