Cutting,grinding,and finishing vAs a rule,grinding wheels are used for rougher finishes that won’t be painted,while flap discs grind and finish at once and produce relatively fine finishes.Resin fiber discs can be used for a short lifespan to grind quickly with a relatively fine finish.The desired finish. New Mirror Grinding Super finishing Wheel &quot;Mr.Neo … From rough and finish double layer grinding to single layer grinding,this newly developed wheel delivers mirror finishing that was previously impossible with standard wheels.A stable finishing surface roughness can be obtained. Surface Roughness in Ultra high Precision Grinding of BK7 … Currently,there is little research reports on the performance evaluation ultra high precision grinding of BK7 glass in terms of surface roughness,and its independence on the grinding parameters.The study has used an efficient design of experiment based on response surface modeling technique to predict and optimize the surface roughness values in the ultra high precision grinding of BK7 glass. Grinding and finishing processes The general guidelines for high performance grinding require a 40 60 mesh for rough grinding; a 60 100 mesh for finish grinding; and a 100 320 mesh grain for fine grinding.When selecting a particular grain size one must consider that large grains allow the user to remove material economically but make the material easier to machine by producing longer chips.
