Electrokinetic dewatering of mine tailings from Abstract: Finegrained tailings (leach residue and gypsum) resulting from hydrometallurgical processes (acid leach followed by lime neutralisation) of nickel laterite ores are proving difficult to dewater using conventional dewatering methods (thickeners vacuum filters).To generate a dense nonsegregating slurry or paste that can be deposited on surface in the form of a stable stack,more Tailings Wikipedia 2019731&ensp&#0183&enspTailings,also called mine dumps,culm dumps,slimes,tails,refuse,leach residue,slickens,or terracone (terrikon),are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden,which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining Mine tailings dams: Characteristics,failure 2015510&ensp&#0183&enspThe mining industry does,however,produce enormous volumes of waste.The amount of mine waste produced is of the same order of magnitude as that of fundamental Earthshaping geological processes,some several thousand million tonnes per year (Fyfe,1981 F&#246rstner,1999).The chief waste stream is tailings,which are Amerigo on track with Chile expansion Mining Journal 2018614&ensp&#0183&enspMVC,which processes tailings from El Teniente under a longterm tolling arrangement between Amerigo and Codelco,yielded 14.2Mlb of copper in Q1 2018 at Towards an integrated approach to tailings management 20121121&ensp&#0183&enspthe study of tailings processes will allow the prediction of downstream outcomes from The Journal of The Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy VOLUME 112 NOVEMBER 2012 965 Towards an integrated approach to tailings management ores will produce greater quantities of tailings per ton of Mineral Processing Wastes Material Description User These wastes can be subdivided into a number of egories: waste rock,mill tailings,coal refuse,wash slimes,and spent oil shale.The mining and processing of mineral ores results in the production of large quantities of residual wastes that are for the most part earth or rocklike in nature. MANAGEMENT OF MINING,QUARRYING AND ORE 2016617&ensp&#0183&enspmanagement of mining,quarrying and oreprocessing waste in the European Union.This project was completed mainly through the use of questionnaire sent to subcontractors in almost each country of the EU.To assess this information and to extrapolate to the next twenty years,this approach has been reinforced using published S.C.Motta Cabrera's research works The University of The oil sands mining and extraction processes in Canada produce large volumes of tailings that are a mixture of mainly water,clay,sand,chemicals and bitumen. Mining Wikipedia 2019730&ensp&#0183&enspMining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth,usually from an ore body,lode,vein,seam,reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,chalk,dimension Special Issue &quotTowards a Sustainable Management of Mine Large volumes of disposed mine tailings abound in several regions of South Africa,as a consequence of unregulated,unsustainable long years of mining activities.Tailings dumps occupy a large volume of valuable land,and present a potential risk for aquatic systems,through leaching of potentially toxic chemical species.  ingsfo What are tailings?
