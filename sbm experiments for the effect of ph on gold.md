E ect of pH on Pulp Potential and Sulphide Mineral Flotation Control of pH is one of the most widely applied methods for the modulation of mineral ﬂotation.In this study the e ect of pH on potential in solution and sulphur minerals ﬂotation is discussed with various electrodes.The electrodes were platinum,gold,chalcopyrite,pyrite and galena.In pH Wikipedia 2019721&ensp&#0183&enspIn chemistry,pH ( piːˈeɪtʃ ) is a scale used to specify how acidic or basic a waterbased solution is.Acidic solutions have a lower pH,while basic solutions have a higher pH.At room temperature (25 &#176C),pure water is neither acidic nor basic and has a pH of 7.The pH scale is logarithmic and approximates the negative of the base 10
