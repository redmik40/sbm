Coal mining When coal seams are near the surface,it may be economical to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast,open pit,mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods.Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods,as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited.

Underground versus Open Pit Mining Unlike open pit,underground mining requires that you take into account a wide variety of added requirements.These include complex ventilation systems,area and local ground support,and of course finding a consistent,safe,and cost effective way to get your materials to the surface. Surface mining Surface mining,including strip mining,open pit mining and mountaintop removal mining,is a broad category of mining in which soil and rock overlying the mineral deposit (the overburden) are removed,in contrast to underground mining,in which the overlying rock is left in place,and the mineral is removed through shafts or tunnels.
