adjust them to meet the requirements of a particular application Menril Tree nbsp 0183 32 The Menril Tree is a tree added by Integrated Dynamics It spawns occasionally in the Overworld and abundantly in Meneglin biomes Menril trees grow additional logs around their base similarly to roots and their trunk will extend into a 3x3 cross where their leaves start They require a 3x3 free area with dirt underneath with the sapling in the center in order to grow properly They require IndustrialCraft 2 Guide nbsp 0183 32 Use the forge hammer to make 5 iron plates to turn one furnace into Iron Furnace
