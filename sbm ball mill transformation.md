In contrast to these results,we have found that either of the two types of transformation can occur during ball milling,but the milling conditions required for the two transformations to occur are different.We suggest that the phase transformation of cobalt induced by ball Planetary Ball Mill A Planetary Ball Mill for rapid fine crushing of soft,hard,brittle and fibrous material to end fineness &lt;1&#181;m Quick and easy to clean Rapid fine crushing Easy exchange of grinding jars and balls Grinding jars and balls made from a wide range of materials available Grinding jar volume up to 500cc Progr.control End fineness &lt; 1&#181;m CE certified Planetary Ball Mills for fine grinding of soft. Phase transformation of cobalt induced by ball milling. We have found that phase transformation can occur in cobalt when subjected to ball milling.The two modifications of cobalt,i.e.face‐center‐cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close‐packed (hcp) phases,which usually coexist at room temperature and are often difficult to be separated from each other,can now be easily separated by using the simple ball milling technique. Particle Size Distribution of Grinding Mill Products The ball load was 455 stainless steel balls one inch in diameter,having a total weight of 30 kg.The particle size distribution was observed after 20,40,60,80,100,150,200 and 300 ball mill revolutions.The energy input was calculated from the net torque (corrected for the Grinding Media Effect of Ball Size and Properties on Mill Grinding Capacity Current ball milling theory suggests that grinding capacity is influenced by the size of balls charged to the mill.In selecting the appropriate ball charge,the first objective is to determine that ball size which will grind the coarse particles most efficiently.This size should be the largest ball size charged to the mill.
