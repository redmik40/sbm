sbm 3.2 m * 13 m cement millRawmill A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement,and has a ‚Ä¶ Cement mill A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more e International Research Journal of Natural Sciences Vol.1.
