sbm rock polish section porphyry system imagesStratigraphic setting and timing of the Montagne d’Or. The local geological characteristics and genesis of VMS deposits of the northern Guiana Shield are,however,poorly understood.In this contribution,we present a detailed stratigraphic and structural setting of the Montagne d’Or volcanic sequence and new U Pb zircon ages highlighting the genetic connection between gold sulphide mineralization and its volcanic framework. Porphyry copper deposit Porphyry copper deposits are copper orebodies that are formed from hydrothermal fluids that originate from a voluminous magma chamber several kilometers below the deposit itself.Predating or associated with those fluids are vertical dikes of porphyritic intrusive rocks from which this deposit type Diorite Diorite is an extremely hard rock,making it difficult to carve and work with,its hardness,however,also allows it to be worked finely and take a high polish,and to provide a durable finished work.One comparatively frequent use of diorite was for inscription,as it is easier to carve in relief than in three dimensional statuary.
