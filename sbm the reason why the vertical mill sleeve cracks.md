sbm the reason why the vertical mill sleeve cracksThe 50 Failure Modes of Electric Motors The 50 Failure Modes of Electric Motors June 18th,2014 Electric motors are essential to numerous plants operations,no matter the industry,which is why understanding their 50 failure modes can help you develop a better maintenance program in your plant. Foundation Cracks: When To Start Worrying &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Just like the horizontal crack is bad news,so is a vertical crack.Cracks that present wider at the top usually mean the foundation is dropping or the center of the foundation is heaving.For cracks that are wider at the bottom,the foundation is likely heaving and the center is dropping. Grinding Wheel Use &amp; Precautions Safe Handling and. The diameters of sleeve flanges and adaptor flanges must be larger than values calculated from the formula below.The radial width of bearing surface must be larger than values given in Table 9 12 depending on the wheel diameter and the maximum operating speeds.A sleeve flange is given in Figure 9 5,and is used for precision grinding. UNDERSTANDING COUPLING MISALIGNMENT AND … &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;There is good reason why vertical angular correction is the next step.The soft foot has been corrected so when you have made the correction this part of the alignment is complete.It does not matter how many times you loosen the motor bolts and re torque,the motor is now sitting flat and your coupling gap reading will remain the same.
