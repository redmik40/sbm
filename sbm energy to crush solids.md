sbm energy to crush solidsCrush Analysis Collision Recon Crush Analysis A crush or energy analysis is the scientific process of quantifying energy for the purpose of determining speeds associated with a crash event A vehicle running into something solid will suffer crush damage as its forward motion suddenly stops How Do Watermills Make Electricity? Sciencing A water wheel converts the potential energy in a flowing stream or waterfall (mgh) into tangential kinetic energy at the point at which the water makes contact with the wheel.This generates rotational kinetic energy,given by I ω 2 2,where ω is the angular velocity of the wheel and I is the moment of inertia.The moment of inertia of a point rotating around a central axis is proportional.
