Mining Process Models from Event Logs in Distributed So we have researched how to discover workflow models,and we have applied the techniques to distributed bioinformatics workflows.The source for such techniques is a &quotworkflow log&quot containing information about the workflow process.We presented a new algorithm to extract a process model from such a log and represented it in terms of a Petri net.

Business Process Mining: Automatic Extraction of Business ProcessMining is the method of distilling a structured process description from a set of real execution.The real executions are captured in an eventlog.The eventlog is the data basis for process mining.Thus,process mining can only yield to meaningful results if the log files contain sufficient information and if the events are logged Process mining: a research agenda ScienceDirect Process mining can be seen as a technology to contribute to this.The goal of process mining is to extract an explicit process model from event logs,i.e.the challenge to create a process model given a log with events such that the model is consistent with the observed dynamic behavior.
