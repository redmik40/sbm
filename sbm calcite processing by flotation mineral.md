Improved Flotation Separation of Apatite from Calcite … Apatite (Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 F 2) is the most important phosphate mineral,and flotation is the main beneficiation method to separate apatite from its major gangue mineral calcite (CaCO 3).Till date,fatty acids and their salts have been widely used as collectors in the apatite calcite flotation separation due to their low cost and strong collecting ability,but their selectivity is limited. Mineral Processing Gaudin (Flotation,McGraw Hill,1957),Wills (Mineral processing technology,Per gamon 1979 and further editions),Kelly and Spottiswood (Introduction to mineral processing,Wiley 1982),Leja (Surface chemistry of froth flotation,Plenum Press 1982),Wiess 「calcite beneficiation process in laos」 calcite beneficiation process in laos Calcite Processing by Flotation for BeneficiationThe Problem with Calcite Processing &amp; Flotation The availability of high lime rock is often limited and it becomes necessary to use lower gr average life of beneficiation plant average.
