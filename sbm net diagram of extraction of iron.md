How Aeration Tanks for Water Treatment Work How Aeration Systems for Water Treatment Work Aeration is used in water treatment as a pretreatment in the process of removing iron and hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg smell) from water Air is a powerful oxidizer of both iron and hydrogen sulfide It quickly converts unfilterable ferrous iron to filterable ferric iron,and it reduces hydrogen. Electrolytic Rust Removal (Electrolysis) QSL During this process,much of the red rust is converted to Fe 3 O 4 and becomes detached from the surface,aiding its removal when the conversion is complete The iron anode,or positive electrode,should be considered to be expendable and can be expected to corrode as a result primarily of the presence of molecular oxygen combining with the iron Metals ScienceQuiz The diagram shows four test tubes,each containing water and a metal: calcium,magnesium zinc and copper respectively Which one of these metals is most reactive with water?
