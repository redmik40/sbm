Designing a Conveyor System The Conveyor Design To solve a conveyor problem,certain facts must first be known.This information is essential for sound conveyor engineering: tonnage per hour,average size of material,maximum lump sizes,weight of material in pounds per cubic foot,conveyor pulley centers in feet,whether conveyor is to operate horizontally or on an incline (18 should be the maximum inclination) and. Conveyor Design Reduces Dust and Enhances Safety … Modern design techniques such as discrete element modeling (DEM) for chute design and 3D modeling for fabrication have been used to improve conveyor system reliability,productivity and safety. Belt Conveyor Transfer Points Proper belt loading is primarily determined by the engineering and design of the conveyor transfer point.General Design Considerations In the preliminary study of a material handling system involving belt conveyors,the number of belt transfer points should be reduced to a minimum in order to reduce degradation,dust and cost. Transfer Chute Design Tunra Bulk Solids Transfer Chute Design Transfer chutes are used in bulk handling systems to perform a variety of operations.For instance accelerating the bulk material from a slow moving belt or apron feeder onto a conveyor,or capturing and re directing the flow of bulk material from one conveyor belt to another.
