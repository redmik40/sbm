sbm phosphate ore european version of the millUS mini mill costs drop below integrated mill costs…but. US mini mills are typically higher cost.On an operating cost basis,US integrated mills are typically lower cost than their mini mill peers.Scrap prices are tied to the marginal cost of hot metal production—meaning that the input for scrap based steelmaking is typically higher than the average ironmaking bulks mix (n.b.iron ore,coal and coke).
