Concrete gains strength with time after casting.It takes What is the difference between C30 concrete and M30, M30 signifies that the a CUBE of size 15cm*15cm*15cm made of cement+ coarse aggregates+ Fine aggregates in such a ratio that its characteristic strength is 30N mm^2 after 28 days of curing,whereas C30 symbolizes a CYLINDRICAL sample in which cemen. Relationship Between Seven and 28 Day Strengths Concrete, Question: Before placing the concrete for the last pier of a drilled pier foundation job,the foreman decided to add water to the ready mix truck The inspector didn't like the looks of the watered down concrete and took test cylinders that represented that one pier The specifications call for a 28 day strength of 3000 psi Strength development in concrete understanding For example,a cement described as conforming to EN 1971 CEM I 42.5 N would be expected to achieve at least 42.5 MPa at 28 days using the specified mortar prism test.Whether 'real concrete' made from that cement will achieve 42.5 MPa in concrete cube tests depends on a range of other factors in addition to any intrinsic properties of the cement.
