Belt filter Filter Press is a kind of mechanical dewatering equipment which uses filter mediums to exert certain pressure on the mixtures to make the liquid filtering out.C.Undercurrent flow Unidirectional Washing is that the washing liquids enter the filter plates in turn from the washing liquids of the thrust plate,passes through the filter cloths and then through the filter cakes,and then flow out. Types Of Filter Media There are two main types of vacuum filters: horizontal belt and rotary drum filters,both of which operate continuously.Horizontal belt vacuum filter includes a conveyor belt,while rotary drum filters rotate about an axis as a vacuum pulls the filtrate through its walls. Belt Filter Press Systems for Sludge Dewatering How our Belt Filter Press Works Before sludge enters the press it is chemically conditioned for dewatering with an emulsion polymer flocculant that helps form stronger flocs.After chemical conditioning,a transfer pump drops the sludge onto a preliminary dewatering belt where free water molecules separate by gravity and fall into a collection trough. Belt Filter Press Komline Sanderson A Belt Filter Press is a sludge dewatering device that applies mechanical pressure to a chemically conditioned slurry,which is sandwiched between two (2) tensioned belts,by passing those belts through a serpentine of decreasing diameter rolls.
