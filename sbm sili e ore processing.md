Zinc &amp Lead Metal Nyrstar Zinc.A global leader in zinc: Nyrstar is one of the world's largest zinc smelting companies based on production volumes.Nyrstar produces zinc in concentrate from its mining operations and a variety of refined market zinc products including special high grade zinc (SHG),zinc galvanising alloys,and zinc diecasting alloys as an outcome of its zinc smelting process. Chromium processing Britannica Chromium processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products.Chromium (Cr) is a brilliant,hard,refractory metal that melts at 1,857 &#176C (3,375 &#176F) and boils at 2,672 &#176C (4,842 &#176F).In the pure state it is resistant to ordinary corrosion,resulting in its appliion as an electroplated Reprocessing UniWiki Compressed ores require 1 unit to process,while uncompressed ores require 100 units.You cannot process uncompressed ores with less than 100 units of a single type,e.g.75 units of Veldspar cannot be combined with 25 units of Dense Veldspar for processing.Both compressed and uncompressed ores yield the same amount of minerals per batch.

Slag Wikipedia Slag is the glass like by product left over after a desired metal has been separated (i.e.smelted) from its raw ore.Slag is usually a mixture of metal oxides and silicon dioxide.Any sandy component or quartz component of the original ore automatically carries through the smelting process as silicon dioxide.As the slag is.

How Is Gold Processed? Reference Gold is processed by cyanide milling,a chemical procedure that separates 95 to 98 percent of the gold from raw mined ore.It is then refined to the gold standard purity,according to Mineweb.Heap leaching is a less expensive method of gold extraction,but it is a longer process and it recovers less gold than the cyanide milling process.
