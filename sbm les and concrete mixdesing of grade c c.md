What is the ratio of concrete in M30 grade? M30 stands for the mix of concrete which after 28 days of curing will give the strength of 30 N mm&#178;.At my site for building construction grade M30 is being used.Ratio of the ingredients are following for M30 concrete mix ( In Liter ) : CEMENT . Properties of Different Grades of Concrete Using Mix. 25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Results of the characteristics of different grades of concrete using mix design method are discussed in terms of density,compressive strength,flexural strength and workability.4.2 Density of Specimen Table 4 shows density of concrete cubes ranging from 2441kg m&#179; to 2588kg m&#179;.These values fall within the density Different Types of Concrete Strengths and Their Uses … GRADE: C40 CONCRETE Strength: 40 Newtons after 28 days.C40 is a strong grade of concrete that is mostly used on commercial construction sites,where it will be utilised to create foundations and beams for support and roads.C40 is also used in It is also.
