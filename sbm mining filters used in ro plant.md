Reverse Osmosis,commonly referred to as RO,is a process where you demineralize or deionize water by pushing it under pressure through a semi permeable Reverse Osmosis Membrane.Osmosis To understand the purpose and process of Reverse Osmosis you must first understand the naturally occurring process of Osmosis. FILTRATION 8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The material used in filters for public water supply is normally a bed of sand,coal,or other granular substance.Filtration processes can generally be classified as being either slow or rapid.Slow sand filters are the original form of filtration.The first one was built in 1804 by John Gibb of Paisley,Scotland to treat water for his How Reverse Osmosis Works ESP Water Products There may be more than one pre filter used in a Reverse Osmosis system,the most common being sediment and carbon filters.These pre filters are used to PROTECT the RO membranes by removing sand silt,dirt,and other sediment that could clog the system.Additionally,carbon filters may be used to remove chlorine,which can damage the RO membranes. Types of Reverse Osmosis Filters Reverse osmosis filters are important for producing clean water for many application purposes.For example,reverse osmosis filters are used to produce clean drinking water (home and retail purposes).Reverse osmosis filters are also used to produce clean water for making medicine such as serum; combining clean water with medical liquids. &quot;reverse osmosis&quot; in Used Industrial Machinery.
