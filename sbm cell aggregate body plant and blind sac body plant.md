KATAMARI1 MURUS3 Is a Novel Golgi Membrane. Plant Cell In plant cells,unlike animal and yeast cells,endomembrane dynamics appear to depend more on actin filaments than on microtubules.However,the molecular mechanisms of endomembrane actin filament interactions are unknown.In this study,we isolated and characterized an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant,katamari1 ( kam1 ),which has a defect in the organization of endomembranes and actin filaments.

The Scientific Roots of Modern Plant.
