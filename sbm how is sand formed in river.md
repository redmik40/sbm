What is a Delta Landform?.For a delta to form,the rate of deposition must exceed the rate of sediment removal.Since sand is the coarsest,it’s deposited close to the mouth of the river.The finer sediment (silt,fine sand,and clay) is deposited next.The outcome is a unique series of layers called topsets,foresets,and bottomsets. Bar (river morphology) A bar in a river is an elevated region of sediment (such as sand or gravel) that has been deposited by the flow.Types of bars include mid channel bars (also called braid bars,and common in braided rivers),point bars (common in meandering rivers),and mouth bars (common in river deltas).). Sand Engineers call sand anything between 0.074 and 2 millimeter,or between a U.S.standard #200 sieve and a #10 sieve.Soil scientists classify grains between 0.05 and 2 mm as sand,or between sieves #270 and #10.Sedimentologists put sand between 0.062 mm (1.
