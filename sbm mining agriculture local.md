produces a wide variety of fossil fuels metals and industrial minerals due to its complex geology In 2013 there were over 2 000 active mines quarries and offshore drilling sites on the continental

mining is a complex issue as Peru tries to balance natural resource management and the health of local indigenous communities with its continued growth and development goals In partnership with Peru USAID works with affected communities to address social conflicts rehabilitate affected land and prevent the expansion of illegal mining into protected areas and other forested lands A survey of semantic web technology for agriculture nbsp 0183 32 Agriculture and in particular precision agriculture is currently generating ever increasing volumes of raw data from sources such as soil sensors drones and local weather stations Raw data in itself is meaningless and isolated and therefore may offer little value to the farmer Types of Agriculture nbsp 0183 32 Types of Agriculture Agriculture is one of the most widespread activities in the world but it is not uniform throughout There are a number of ways to classify agriculture and some of the major criteria which can be adopted include

intensification of agriculture for global food nbsp 0183 32 Remove and restore marginal soils from productive agriculture with these soils often suffering the greatest degradation and also providing the lowest productivity 3 Practice conservation agriculture for example reduced tillage in order to reduce the rate at which soil OM is lost from soils increase water infiltration and storage and reduce erosion for example see Somasundaram et al
