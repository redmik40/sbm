Bauxite is the name for a mixture of similar minerals that contain hydrated aluminum oxides.Bauxite is a naturally occurring,heterogeneous ore composed chiefly of aluminous oxide minerals as gibbsite (Al2O3.3H2O),the trihydrate,bohemite,diaspore (Al2O3.H2O) and monohydrates etc. Pre desilication and digestion of gibbsitic bauxite with.  · The effect of lime on the pre desilication and digestion of gibbsitic bauxite in synthetic sodium aluminate liquor at different temperatures was investigated.The bauxite is comprised of gibbsite,aluminogoethite,hematite,kaolin,quartz,and minor boehmite.Lime increases the desilication efficiency of the bauxite during the pre desilication process by promoting the conversion of sodalite. Mining and Refining Process The bauxite residue sinks to the bottom of the settling tanks,then is transferred to the washing tanks,where it undergoes a series of washing stages to recover the caustic soda (which is reused in the digestion process).Further separation of the pregnant liquor from the bauxite residue is performed utilising a series of security filters. The Chemistry and Processing of Jamaican Bauxite In October,1943,Alcan was incorporated under the name Jamaica Bauxites Limited as a Jamaican company to investigate the commercial potential of Jamaican bauxite.In the same year,2500 tonnes of ore was shipped to the USA for process investigation and it was realised that the bauxite was suitable for processing using Bayer technology.
