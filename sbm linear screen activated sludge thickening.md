The thickening and treatment of sewage sludges to minimize primary sludges and techniques for the thickening and dewatering of primary and waste activated sludges to minimize phosphate release into the liquors so produced.The technique of sludge thickening on linear screens is described and the coupling of linear screens to belt presses to complete the dewatering operation. Sludge thickening Emo France Thickening aims at increasing the dryness (content of dried matters) of sludge without modifiying the liquid character of the sludge.This thickening can be done simply by gravitating mechanic ways (thickening or flottation).Dryness of thickened sludge at the gravity belt thickener outlet can range between 6 and 8%. best sludge thickeners sinosteelplaza Sludge Thickening Technologies Reduce Wastewater.Sludge Thickening.The thickening of activated sludge is a common practice many wastewater treatment plants.These plants use a biological treatment process to reduce the wastewater COD and BOD before discharging downstream into the environment.
