Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;SAG mill make use of steel balls included with some large and hard rocks for grinding.These mills utilize the balls in making the large fragments of materials broken into pieces.The ball charge of a SAG mill is about 9% to 20%.This process takes place inside the large rotating drum of SAG mill which is filled with balls partially. Rod Mills The following cost advantages should be considered when evaluating rod mill grinding: Rod Mills use low cost grinding media.The fineness of grind and tonnage may be easily varied by altering the mill speed,rod charge or dilution.These rods run the length of the machine,which is most commonly between eight and six Rod mills,how they function 26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.
