Digestive System Processes and Regulation Anatomy and. The digestive system ingests and digests food,absorbs released nutrients,and excretes food components that are indigestible.The six activities involved in this process are ingestion,motility,mechanical digestion,chemical digestion,absorption,and defecation.These processes are regulated by neural and hormonal mechanisms. Karst Features and Hydrogeology in West central Florida A. Little surface expression of karst occurs,although the buried limestone units can have significant secondary porosity.Although sinkhole features are not common,when observed,they are usually large diameter,deep,cover collapse type sinkholes,indicating the presence of buried karst limestone.Karstification and Hydrogeology Environmental Hazards of Limestone Mining Education. Limestone deposits often occur in association with karst,a topography where limestone slowly dissolves away underground.The deposits result in sinkholes,caves and areas of rock fractures that form underground drainage areas.When mining occurs in karst,disruption to natural aquifers,or flows of underground water,can result. Weathering What is limestone? Limestone landscapes. Mechanical,or physical,weathering has taken place in limestone landscapes such as the Pennines of Yorkshire.An example is 'freeze thaw' where water soaks into small fissures and cracks,expands when it freezes in the winter,and physically breaks the limestone. Karst Processes and Landforms Earth 530: The Critical Zone Karst Processes and Landforms.The areas that are bare,that is the two ridges we pointed to earlier,are both underlain by shale and sandstone.Over time,the reactions like this that naturally occur,from dilute carbonic acids formed in the atmosphere,cause the dissolution of limestone and the formation of these features. What Is Chemical Weathering? With Examples Science Trends  · Limestone is slowly dissolved and becomes weathered overtime as this process continues.Carbonation,like many chemical weathering processes,is affected also by the temperature of the surrounding environment.As it gets colder,carbonation occurs more frequently because the cold water has more carbon dioxide in it.
