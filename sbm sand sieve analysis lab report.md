Sieve analysis Wikipedia A sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used (commonly used in civil engineering) to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material by allowing the material to pass through a series of sieves of progressively smaller mesh size and weighing the amount of material that is stopped by each sieve as a fraction of the whole mass. Sieve Analysis Particle Technology Labs A sieve analysis consists of using a single or set of screens (typically woven wire mesh),decreasing in opening size,to separate or classify a sample.Sieve results are reported as the differential weight percent retained on each sieve as well as the cumulative weight percent less than the sieve size. Exp 3 Sieve Analysis Civil Engineers PK Sieve Analysis.As we know that the Fineness modulus is a measurement of the coarseness or fineness of a given aggregate,higher the FM the coarser the aggregate.The above table is showing us that the Laurence pure sand is coarser then Chenab sand and similarly Sargodha crush is coarser then margala crush.
