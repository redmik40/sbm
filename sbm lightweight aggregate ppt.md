Lightweight Aggregates: How Do You Make the Right The use of lightweight aggregates may have an impact on the compressive strength of the concrete.Highly absorptive lightweight aggregate should be wetted at least 24 hours prior to use.It is not recommended that dry lightweight aggregate be directly batched and mixed because the aggregate particles can continue to absorb water from the mix.
