Mill (grinding) SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor. SAG Mill Process Control If the SAG mill is not intended to be the rate limiting step in a process plant,then it is best to adjust the SAG load (and power) to hold a constant tonnage to satisfy another constraint elsewhere.Underground mines are an example: the hoisting capacity of the mine shaft is the rate limiting step in the proce Gearless Mill Drives Project: One SAG Mill and 3 Ball Mill Drive Systems Capacity: SAG Mill 1000 t h Ball Mills 1000 t h Consultant: Bechtel,USA Mill Builder: FFE Minerals,USA.Flotation Separation Conditioning Grinding Water SAG Ball Mill Primary Crushing Ore Storage Leaching Leached Solution Dryers Electro Winn Estimated Water Requirements for the Conventional.
