sbm capacity of a crusherTECHNICAL NOTES 5 CRUSHERS The capacity of the crusher is determined by its size.The gape determines the maximum size of material that can be accepted.Maximum size that can be accepted into the crusher is approximately 80% of the gape.Jaw crushers are operated to produce a size reduction ratio between 4:1 and 9:1.Gyratory crushers Rock Crusher Capacities Crusher Mills,Cone Crusher,Jaw. Gyratory crusher capacity Stone Crushers.Over 1,000 tph,select a gyratory crusher.Between these capacities,you have a choice.‚Ä crusher with capacity of crushing Crushers Primary crushing with impact crushers.The primary impact crusher offers high capacity and is designed to accept large feed sizes.The primary impact crushers are used to process from 200 t h up to 1900 t h and feed sizes of up to 1830 mm (71&quot;) in the largest model. Crusher A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition c Gyratory Crusher Since the gyratory,unlike the jaw crusher,crushes on full cycle,it has a higher capacity than a jaw crusher of the same gape,roughly by a factor of 2.5 3,and is usually favored in plants handling large throughputs: in mines with crushing rates above 900 t h ‚àí1,gyratory crushers are always selected.
