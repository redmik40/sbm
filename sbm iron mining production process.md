Iron ore Iron ores[1] are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted.The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey,bright yellow,or deep purple to rusty red.The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3O 4,72.4% Fe),hematite (Fe 2O 3,69.9% Fe),goethite (FeO(OH),62.9% Fe. Iron processing Iron processing Iron processing Ores: Iron ores occur in igneous,metamorphic (transformed),or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments.Most are sedimentary,but many have been changed by weathering,and so their precise origin is difficult to determine.The most widely distributed iron bearing minerals are oxides,and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3),which is. A Look at the Process of Pelletizing Iron Ore for Steel … The production of iron ore pellets from fines to finished product can differ based on a variety of factors.As such,it’s important to note that the process described here is a … How iron is made The European iron workers knew the Easterners had better iron,but not the processes involved in fashioning stronger iron products.Entire nations launched efforts to discover the process.The first known European breakthrough in the production of cast iron,which led quickly to the first practical steel,did not come until 1740.
