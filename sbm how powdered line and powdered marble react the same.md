GCSE CHEMISTRY What is the Effect of Increasing the, The reaction rate is faster (the slope is steeper) for the reaction with the small marble chips because these have a greater surface area and therefore they produce carbon dioxide more quickly Both lines on the graph finish at the same place This shows that the final loss of mass (the amount of carbon dioxide produced) is the same for both. No Brain Too Small SCIENCE QUESTION SUGGESTED ANSWER The, that affect reaction rat Marble is made up of calcium carbonate,CaCO 3,which readily reacts with hydrochloric acid,HCl A laboratory experiment involved adding 100 gram of marble chips to 100 mL of hydrochloric acid in test tube A and 100 gram of smaller marble chips to 100 mL of the same concentration of hydrochloric acid in test. 72 Rates of reaction and factors affecting rate Siyavula The reaction with powdered marble is faster,draw a line on the same set of axes to show how you would expect the reaction to proceed with a more concentrated \(\text{HCl}\) solution The red line indicates roughly how the.

Synonyms of Dolomite includes Marble,Line,dolostone etc.acid is warm or if the dolomite is powdered a much stronger acid reaction will be observed. Effect of surface area on rates of reaction You would expect the reaction to be slower because the surface area of the larger chips is less So the graph would be less steep at the beginning But eventually,if you waited long enough,you would get the same mass loss if you started with the same mass of marble and the same volume of the same hydrochloric ac Marble: Characteristics,Uses And Problems GSA Aug 2,2016.It is formed as a result of the recrystallization of line under the.Chlorides,nitrates,sulfates and other chemical compounds react differently with marble and.of marble by using marble polishing powder and soft buffing pads.Biological agents can also collect on dirty surfaces and the same water.

Oxford Cambridge and RSA Friday 9 June 2017 Morning 200 g of marble chips balance Harry and Ann measure the mass every minute until the reaction stops They calculate the total mass of carbon dioxide made They do the experiment again They use the same volume of dilute acid and the same mass of marble This time they use smaller marble chips Results Big Pieces or Small Pieces: Which React Faster? The smaller the reactant gets the more surface area it takes up as it is the same amount at the larger pieces except the pieces are much smaller here therefore spreading more As they were small they took up more space so they reacted much more easily and quickly than they would if they were larger The powdered tablet did dissolve faster than.
