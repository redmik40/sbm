GHGRP Underground Coal Mines Greenhouse Gas Reporting The Underground Coal Mines sector consists of all underground coal mines that liberate 36,500,000 actual cubic feet of methane (equivalent to approximately 17,579 metric tons CO 2 e) or more per year.Facilities in this sector include both underground coal mines under development and those egorized by the Mine Safety and Health Administration as active mines. Coal mining Underground mining Britannica Coal mining Coal mining Underground mining: In underground coal mining,the working environment is completely enclosed by the geologic medium,which consists of the coal seam and the overlying and underlying strata.Access to the coal seam is gained by suitable openings from the surface,and a network of roadways driven in the seam then facilitates the installation of service facilities
