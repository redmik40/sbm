Wisconsin Geological &amp Natural History Survey &#187 Frac sand This water is reused to wash and transport sand (steps 5 and 6).An important step in processing frac sand,which occurs offsite for this operation,involves drying and sorting the sand into grainsize ranges to meet industry needs.The sand is then shipped out of state by rail or barge. Silica (Frac) Sand Mining Minnesota Legislature Industrial silica sand is also being mined from sandstone areas in Wisconsin,Iowa,and Illinois.There is interest in developing new industrial silica sand mines in Minnesota due to a rapid expansion of shale oil and gas development over the past decade and the use of the hydraulic fracturing extraction method. What is Industrial Sand?
