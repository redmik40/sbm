Rubidium 27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Rubidium is a chemical element with the symbol Rb and atomic number 37.Rubidium is a very soft,silvery white metal in the alkali metal group.Rubidium metal shares similarities to potassium metal and caesium metal in physical appearance,softness and conductivity.Rubidium cannot be stored under atmospheric oxygen,as a highly exothermic reaction will ensue,sometimes even resulting in … (N P) . 8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;：nacreous layer nacreous structure nacrite nadorite naegite nagatelite nagyagite nahcolite nail nakhlite nantokite naphthabitumen Aluminum Cesium Sulfate Dodecahydrate … 17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Aluminum Cesium Sulfate Dodecahydrate is a moderately water and acid soluble Aluminum source for uses compatible with sulfates.Sulfate compounds are salts or esters of sulfuric acid formed by replacing one or both of the hydrogens with a metal.Most metal sulfate compounds are readily soluble in water for uses such as water treatment,unlike fluorides and oxides which tend to be insoluble. Caesium Mining and refining pollucite ore is a selective process and is conducted on a smaller scale than for most other metals.The ore is crushed,hand sorted,but not usually concentrated,and then ground.Caesium is then extracted from pollucite primarily by three methods: acid digestion,alkaline decomposition,and … Process for recovering cesium from cesium alum 21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART.The field of this invention relates to the recovery of cesium from cesium bearing minerals such as pollucite.More specifically,this invention relates to an improvement in such recovery processes wherein the cesium ore is extracted with sulfuric acid to obtain an extract containing cesium alum,CsAl(SO 4) 2 for further processing. Characteristics 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The mining of pollucite ore is a selective process and is conducted on a small scale in comparison with most metal mining operations.The ore is crushed,hand sorted,but not usually concentrated,and then ground.Caesium is then extracted from pollucite mainly by three methods: acid digestion,alkaline decomposition,and direct reduction.[8] [60]  16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;pollucite pollution polonium polybasite polycrase polygon polyhalite polymerization polymorphism polyphase pond pontoon pony cut poor ore poor quality.

Cesium Aluminate AMERICAN ELEMENTS Cesium's main commercial source is pollucite ore; however,it is also found in beryl,avogadrite,pezzottaite,and londonite.Cesium was discovered by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff in 1860 and first isolated by Carl Setterberg in 1882.In its elemental form,cesium has a silvery gold appearance. Cesium : Wikis (The Full Wiki) The mining of pollucite ore,as with other zoned pegmatites,is a selective process and is conducted on a small scale in comparison with most metal mining operations.The ore is crushed,hand sorted,but not usually concentrated,and then ground to prepare it for conversion to caesium metal or compounds.[2] Caesium Mining and refining pollucite ore is a selective process and is conducted on a smaller scale than for most other metals; the ore is crushed,hand sorted,but not usually concentrated,and then ground.Caesium is then extracted from pollucite primarily by three methods: acid digestion,alkaline decomposition,and … O P 23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;oolitic iron ore deposit oolitic limestone oolitic structure ooze.potash alum potash feldspathization potash granite potash rhyolite … Recovery of cesium chloride from pollucite ore 3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A process for recovering purified cesium chloride from pollucite ore in which the ore is digested with aqueous hydrochloric acid and the silica solids removed to obtain an aqueous acidic solution of metal chlorides consisting principally of cesium chloride and aluminum chloride together with ferric chloride and other metal chlorides,wherein.
