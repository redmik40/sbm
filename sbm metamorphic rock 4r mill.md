OneGeology Other common metamorphic rocks are called marble,gneiss,schist.More information.A metamorphic rock is a result of a transformation of a pre existing rock.The original rock is subjected to very high heat and pressure,which cause obvious physical and or chemical changes.Examples of these rock types include marble,slate,gneiss,schist. Archaean Metamorphic Rocks Archaean Metamorphic Rocks.The Archean rocks in Colorado are the oldest.They were metamorphosed about 2.7 billion years before present.That means that the original rocks were even older.Unfortunately,there aren‚Äôt very many of them,only about 40 acres in extrem LOW SULFIDE AU QUARTZ VEINS (MODEL 36a; Berger,1986) greenstone and turbidite sequences that have been metamorphosed to greenschist facies.Wall rocks contain abundant carbonate and sulf ide minerals,quartz,and sericite.Arsenic and antimony are enriched in alteration haloes (fig.1).These deposits are also known as mesothermal,Mother Lode type,orogenic,metamorphic rock hosted,greenstone Oconaluftee (Great Smoky Mountains) The mill operated at wholesale and retail levels until the National Park Service purchased the property in 1934.The mill was restored in 1937,closed during World War II,and reopened in 1968.Water diverted from Mingus Creek via a sluice (canal) and a wooden flume tu Metamorphic rock Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types,in a process called metamorphism,which means &quot;change in form&quot;.The original rock is subjected to heat (temperatures greater than 150 to 200 &#176;C) and pressure (100 megapascals (1,000 bar) or more),causing profound physical or chemical change.The protolith may be a sedimentary,igneous,or existing metamorphic rock. Metamorphic Minerals Remember that all of the igneous minerals can also occur in metamorphic rocks.Those shown here are either rare or absent in igneous rocks,the minerals look somewhat different because of their metamorphic petrogenesis,or if I just like them.Many of the images have two views,most showing paired plane and cross polarized light images.
