An overview of reverse flotation process for coal. Contrary to this,reverse flotation of coal in which coal particles are depressed and gangue particles floated,was developed as an alternative process to minimise the sulphur content in the coal.This method can also be applied to reduce the ash content of coal by floating the mineral matter present in coal. Reverse flotation of sedimentary calcareous dolomitic … The processing of sedimentary dolomitic calcareous phosphate ore has numerous problems,including similar surface properties of the carbonate and phosphate.Two stage reverse anionic flotation of carbonates (dolomite calcite) has appeared to be a promising separation technique for the removal of carbonates from sedimentary rock phosphate. Introduction to Mineral Processing 18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Introduction to Mineral Processing.Froth Flotation Froth flotation is considered to be the most widely used method for ore beneficiation.In ore beneficiation,flotation is a process in which valuable minerals are separated from worthless material or other valuable minerals by inducing them to gather in and on the surface of a froth layer.
