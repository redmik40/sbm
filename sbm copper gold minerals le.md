Ore Genesis at the Jinchang Gold Copper Deposit in. Gold was deposited during all three stages and Stage 1 was the major gold producing stage.Copper is associated with the mineralization but has low economic value.Fluid inclusions (FIs) within the deposit are liquid rich aqueous,vapor rich aqueous,and daughter mineral bearing types. Mining Industry Copper Sulfide Ore and Flotation … 14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;(2) Copper sulfur ore Called copper bearing pyrite.In addition to copper minerals,iron sulfide can be recovered,and the main mineral of sulfur is pyrite.(3) Copper pyrite ore Except for the copper minerals,pyrite and magnetite are worth recovering.Many of the skarn type copper mines in China belong to this type. Gold Precious Metals Keynote The main copper minerals associated with gold are shown in Table 3.The Table also shows their reactivity in a typical cyanide leach solution and the amount of cyanide lost by reactionwith the copper mineral.Notably,all the copper minerals are leached by cyanide to varying degrees, Copper Copper combines with a number of elements and more than 150 copper minerals have been identified,although only a small number of these are of economic importance (Table 2).Copper minerals can be divided into three groups.Primary or hypogene1 minerals related to hy drothermal2 processes include bornite,chalcopyrite and enargite.
