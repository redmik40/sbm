How Portland Cement is Made? Manufacturing … Portland cement can be made by following two different processes a dry one and a wet one.Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century.Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement.The materials that are commonly used are limestone,shells,chalk,shale,clay,slate,silica sand,and iron ore.Since limestone is the main. 12.TESTING OF CEMENT PART 1. 26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cement paste of standard consistence is used for this test.Vicat apparatus is used,but the plunger is replaced by the steel needle in the form of a right cylinder of effective length 50 &#177; 1 mm and diameter 1,13 &#177; 0,05 mm.The total mass of moving part is 300 &#177;1 g.
