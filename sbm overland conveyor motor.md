Gearless drive system for ThyssenKrupp overland conveyor 201312&ensp&#0183&enspThe Siemens Drive Technologies Division has received an order from ThyssenKrupp Robins (Greenwood Village,Colorado,USA) to supply the gearless drive system for the overland conveyor system in the Las Bambas copper mine in Peru owned by Xstrata Copper.Las Bambas will be the second Xstrata Copper mine in Peru to use gearless drives from Siemens on its overland conveyors. Siemens' gearless drive technology powers overland 20191017&ensp&#0183&enspPowered by Siemens' new gearless drive technology,thyssenkrupp's highcapacity overland conveyor will access one of the world's largest copper reserves in Quellaveco.The Quellaveco mine in Peru contains approximately 7.5 million t of copper in ore reserves Conveyors,Aggregate Machinery,Crushers,Feeders,Mining 2012324&ensp&#0183&enspMichigan Aggregate Machinery provides affordable RECONDITIONED Rock Crushers and Mineral Process Machinery to the PIT,QUARRY,MINING and RECYCLE Industry.MAM also offers PLANT DESIGN,APPLICATION ENGINEERING,CRUSHER REPAIR and a variety of related services.
