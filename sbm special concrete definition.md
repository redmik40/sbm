Properties of Concrete University of Memphis 2018821&ensp&#0183&enspProperties of Concrete Concrete is an artificial conglomerate stone made essentially of Portland cement,water,and aggregates.Properties of Concrete While cement in one form or another has been around for centuries,the type we use was invented in 1824 in Britain.It was named Portland cement because it looked like the Glossary of Terms associated with concrete Pervious Concrete Pervious concrete is a special type of concrete with a high porosity used for concrete flatwork appliions that allows water from precipitation and other sources to pass through it,thereby reducing the runoff from a site and recharging ground water levels. STRUCTURE magazine Special Reinforced Concrete Shear The design and detailing requirements for special reinforced concrete shear walls have undergone significant changes from ACI 31811 to ACI 31814.The changes are a result of the unsatisfactory performance of many shear walls in the Chile earthquake of 2010 and the Christchurch,New Zealand earthquake of 2011.
