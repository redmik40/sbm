sbm cone crusher mantle designCone Crusher Unlike a gyratory crusher,which is identified by the dimensions of the feed opening and the mantle diameter,a cone crusher is rated by the diameter of the cone mantle.Cone crushers are also identified by the power draw: for example,the Metso MP1000 refers to 1,000 HP (746 kW),and the FLSmidth XL2000 refers to 2,000 HP (1,491 kW). Crushing Equipment,Cone Crushers,Gyratory Crushers Cone crushers and gyratory crushers are mainly used as secondary crushers in a crushing plant.Crushed product from the primary crusher (usually Jaw Crusher) is fed through the top of the cone crusher and flows over the mantle.A vertical drive shaft rotates the mantle eccentrically below the bowl liner,squeezing the product and crushing it. TECHNICAL NOTES 5 CRUSHERS Mineral Tech 5.1.1 Cone crushers Cone crushers are commonly used for secondary,tertiary and quaternary crushing duties.Two variations are available standard and short head The chief difference between cone and gyratory or jaw crushers is the nearly parallel arrangement of the mantle and the cone at the discharge end in the cone crusher. 72 Best Cone & Jaw Crushers images Gold mining equipment.
